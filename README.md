## Acknowledgments

This theme extends the excellent [Hugo Xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) theme by [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.org), maintaining its minimal philosophy while adding powerful timeline functionality and modern features.

## Configuration

This theme provides comprehensive timeline functionality and additional features:

### Noti.st Integration

The theme supports embedding slides from Noti.st, including custom domain CNAMEs. Configure this in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[params]
  # Your Noti.st username
  notist_username = "your-username"
  
  # Array of custom domains that point to Noti.st
  # This allows the theme to recognize your custom domain as a Noti.st embed
  notist_custom_domains = ["slides.yourdomain.com", "presentations.example.org"]
```

**Example:**
- If you have `slides.anantshri.info` as a CNAME pointing to Noti.st
- Add it to the `notist_custom_domains` array
- The theme will automatically embed slides from that domain using your `notist_username`

### Analytics Configuration

The theme supports multiple analytics providers with flexible configuration:

```toml
[params.analytics]
  provider = "plausible"           # Options: "plausible", "plausible_cloud", "google", "custom"
  domain = "yourdomain.com"        # Your domain for analytics
  
  # For self-hosted Plausible with custom proxy (like nginx redirect):
  api_endpoint = "/api/event"      # Custom API endpoint
  script_src = "/js/script.js"     # Custom script source
  
  # For Plausible Cloud:
  # provider = "plausible_cloud"
  # domain = "yourdomain.com"
  
  # For Google Analytics:
  # provider = "google"
  # tracking_id = "G-XXXXXXXXXX"
  
  # For custom analytics code:
  # provider = "custom"
  # custom_code = '''<script>/* your custom analytics */</script>'''
```

**Self-hosted Plausible Setup:**
1. Set `provider = "plausible"`
2. Configure your nginx proxy to redirect `/api/event` and `/js/script.js` to your Plausible instance
3. Set your domain in the `domain` parameter
4. The theme will use your custom endpoints

**Note:** The nginx configuration for proxying is outside the theme scope but enables privacy-friendly analytics without exposing your analytics server directly.

### Work in Progress Notification System

The theme includes a flexible system for displaying work-in-progress notifications:

```toml
[params.work_in_progress]
  enabled = true                   # Enable/disable globally
  default_message = "This content is currently being updated..."
  default_title = "üöß Work in Progress"
  exclude_statuses = ["discontinued", "archived", "completed", "finished"]  # Don't show WIP for these statuses
  
  # Predefined message types
  [params.work_in_progress.types]
    updating = { title = "üöß Work in Progress", message = "Content being updated..." }
    incomplete = { title = "üìù Content Incomplete", message = "Partial information available..." }
    review = { title = "üîç Under Review", message = "Content under review..." }
    placeholder = { title = "üìã Placeholder", message = "Content coming soon..." }
```

**Usage Options:**

1. **Section-level**: Add to section's `_index.md`:
   ```yaml
   work_in_progress: "updating"  # Use predefined type
   # OR
   work_in_progress: true        # Use default message
   # OR custom message:
   work_in_progress_title: "Custom Title"
   work_in_progress_message: "Custom message here"
   ```

2. **Page-level**: Add to individual page front matter (overrides section-level)
3. **Automatic display**: Shows on both list and single page views
4. **Smart exclusions**: WIP messages are automatically hidden for content with "final" statuses like `discontinued`, `archived`, `completed`, or `finished`

### Navigation System

The theme includes a modern, configurable navigation system:

```toml
[params.navigation]
  enable_breadcrumbs = true           # Enable breadcrumb navigation
  enable_prev_next = true             # Enable previous/next navigation
  breadcrumb_separator = "‚Ä∫"          # Breadcrumb separator character
  show_section_context = true         # Show current section in header
  
  # Configurable navigation labels (for internationalization)
  [params.navigation.labels]
    home = "Home"
    projects = "Projects"
    gadgets = "Gadgets"
    timeline = "Timeline"
    back_to = "Back to"
    previous = "Previous"
    next = "Next"
    currently_used = "Currently Used"
    upcoming = "Upcoming"
    discontinued = "Discontinued"
    discontinued_projects = "Discontinued Projects"
    archived_device = "‚ö†Ô∏è Archived Device"
    planned_device = "üìã Planned Device"
```

**Navigation Features:**
- **Breadcrumb navigation**: Shows `Home ‚Ä∫ Section ‚Ä∫ Current Page` path
- **Previous/Next navigation**: Navigate between adjacent pages in sections
- **Responsive design**: Adapts to mobile and desktop layouts
- **Configurable labels**: Customize all text for internationalization
- **Accessible**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

### Timeline Features

This theme is designed for timeline-based content with support for:
- Activity-based categorization
- Focus area taxonomies
- Embedded content (YouTube, Vimeo, SlideShare, Noti.st)
- Responsive timeline layout
- Configurable activity icons with intelligent fallbacks

#### Activity Icons Configuration

Configure timeline activity icons in your `config.toml`:

```toml
[params.timeline]
  show_activity_icons = true    # Enable/disable activity icons (default: true)
```

#### Icon System Architecture

The theme uses a **hierarchical icon system** that checks multiple locations:

**Theme Icons (Built-in):**
- Default icons included with theme in `themes/anantshri/assets/images/`
- Includes all standard activity icons: `talk.svg`, `tool.svg`, `training.svg`, etc.
- Social media icons: `twitter.svg`, `linkedin.svg`, `mastodon.svg`, etc.
- Notice system icons: `info.svg`, `note.svg`, `tip.svg`, `warning.svg`

**Site-Specific Icons (Optional Override):**
- Place custom icons in your site's `assets/images/` directory
- Same naming format: `{activity-name}.svg` or `{platform}.svg`
- Site icons override theme icons when present

**Icon Requirements:**
- Format: SVG files for scalability
- Activity icons: 25x25px recommended
- Social icons: 50x50px recommended
- Notice icons: Included with theme

**Fallback Behavior:**
- **First**: Checks site `assets/images/` for custom icons
- **Second**: Falls back to theme's built-in icons
- **Third**: Shows styled text badges/links if no icons found
- **Configuration**: `show_activity_icons = false` disables all icons

## New Features Added (Extracted from hugo_booster)

### Notice/Admonition System

**Usage:**
```hugo
{{< notice warning >}}
This is a warning message with custom styling!

This is an info box with a custom title.
{{< /notice >}}
```

**Available Types:**

- `tip` - Green tip notices
- `note` - Blue note notices (default)

**Features:**
