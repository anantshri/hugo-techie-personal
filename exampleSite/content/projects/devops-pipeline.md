- **Infrastructure Pipeline** - Terraform-based infrastructure with security policies
- **Container Pipeline** - Docker image building with vulnerability scanning

#### GitLab CI Templates  
- **Multi-environment Deployment** - Dev/staging/production with progressive security checks
- **Compliance Pipeline** - SOC 2 and PCI DSS compliance automation
- **Mobile App Pipeline** - iOS/Android app security and deployment
- **Library Publishing** - Package publishing with security verification

#### Jenkins Pipeline Scripts
- **Enterprise Integration** - Legacy system integration with modern security
- **Hybrid Cloud Deployment** - Multi-cloud deployment with security consistency
- **Batch Processing** - Secure data processing pipeline templates

## Key Features
